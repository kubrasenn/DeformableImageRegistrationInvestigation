	abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells into biofluids and hold great promise as reservoirs of disease biomarkers. One of the main challenges in studying EVs and using them for diagnostics is a lack of methods to quantify EVs that are sensitive enough and can differentiate EVs from similarly sized lipoproteins and protein aggregates. We demonstrate the use of ultrasensitive assays to quantify EVs by immuno-isolating and detecting EV transmembrane proteins in microwell arrays. We developed single molecule array (Simoa) assays for the quantification of EVs using three widely expressed transmembrane proteins: the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81. Using Simoa to measure these three EV markers, as well as albumin to measure protein contamination, we were able to compare the relative efficiency and purity of several commonly used EV isolation methods in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): ultracentrifugation, precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We further used these assays to rapidly optimize EV isolation using SEC from plasma and CSF. Our results highlight the utility of quantifying EVs using Simoa and provide a rapid framework for comparing and improving EV isolation methods from biofluids.Competing Interest StatementDRW is the scientific founder and a board member of Quanterix Inc.

              nanoparticles with clinical applications. In blood plasma, EVs
              are outnumbered by similar-sized lipoprotein particles (LPs),
              leading to controversial data such as non-specific binding of
              antibodies to LPs. Flow cytometry is a clinically applicable
              technique to characterize single EVs in body fluids. However,
              flow cytometry data have arbitrary units, impeding
              standardization, data comparison, and data interpretation, such
              as differentiation between EVs and LPs. Here we present a new
              method, named flow cytometry scatter ratio (Flow-SR), to relate
              the ambiguous light scattering signals of flow cytometry to the
              diameter and refractive index (RI) of single nanoparticles
              between 200-500 nm in diameter. Flow-SR enables label-free
              differentiation between EVs and LPs and improves data
              interpretation and comparison. Because Flow-SR is easy to
              implement, widely applicable, and more accurate and faster than
              existing techniques to size nanoparticles in suspension, Flow-SR
              has numerous applications in nanomedicine.",

              operating procedure to reproducibly measure the PSD. The PSDs of
              particles in human plasma, conditioned medium of PC3 prostate
              cancer cell line (PC3 CM), and human urine were measured with
              MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC) to investigate: (i) the optimal
              diluent that reduces the interfacial tension of the sample while
              keeping EVs intact, (ii) the lower limit of detection (LoD) of
              particle size, (iii) the reproducibility of the PSD, (iv) the
              optimal dilution for measuring the PSD, and (v) the agreement in
              measured concentration between microfluidic cartridges with
              overlapping detection ranges. We found that the optimal diluent
              is 0.1\% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Dulbecco's
              phosphate-buffered saline. Based on the shape of the PSD, which
              is expected to follow a power-law function within the full
              detection range, we obtained a lower LoD of 75 nm for plasma and
              PC3 CM and 65 nm for urine. Normalized PSDs are reproducible (R2
              > 0.950) at dilutions between 10-100x for plasma, 5-20x for PC3
              CM, and 2-4x for urine. Furthermore, sample dilution does not
              impact the dilution-corrected concentration when the microfluidic
              cartridges are operated within their specified concentration
              ranges. PSDs from microfluidic cartridges with overlapping
              detection ranges agreed well (R2 > 0.936) and when combined the
              overall PSD spanned 5 orders of magnitude of measured
              concentration. Based on these findings, we have developed
              operating guidelines to reproducibly measure the PSD of EVs

There are many different size characterization techniques used in the field, which often report different size values. Besides technological biases, these differences originate from the fact that various methods measure different physical quantities to determine particle size. In this study, the size of synthetic liposomes with nominal diameters of 50nm and 100nm, and red blood cell-derived EVs (REVs) were measured with established optical methods, such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and with emerging non-optical methods such as microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS) and very small-angle neutron scattering (VSANS). The comparison of the hydrodynamic sizes obtained by DLS and NTA with the sizes corresponding to the excluded volume of the particles by MRPS enabled the estimation of the thickness of the hydration shell of the particles. The comparison of diameter values corresponding to the boundary of the phospholipid bilayer obtained from VSANS measurements with MRPS size values revealed the thickness of the polyethylene glycol-layer in case of synthetic liposomes, and the thickness of the protein corona in case of REVs.}

  abstract = "We investigated the fluorescence emission from three fluorophores commonly used for labeling cells in flow cytometry. We have demonstrated that the fluorescence emission from cells labeled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), and allophycocyanin (APC) is considerably saturated and bleached in standard flow cytometric conditions. Therefore, for optimization of fluorescence detection in a flow cytometer, it is important to know the emission kinetics in detail. We made a mathematical model of the optical processes involved: absorption, fluorescence emission, nonradiative decay, photodestruction, and triplet state occupation. The validity of the model was experimentally tested with a set of averaged fluorescence pulses, measured in a large range of intensities and illumination times. The fluorescence of APC could be completely described by the model and produced the following rate constants: photodestruction rate kb1 = 6 · 103 s-1, triplet state population rate k12 = 2 · 105 s-1, and depopulation rate k20 = 5 · 104 s-1. The fluorescence kinetics of FITC- and PE-labeled cells could not be fitted with only three parameters over the entire range, indicating that other optical processes are involved. We used the model to determine the sensitivity of our flow cytometer and to calculate the optimum conditions for the detection of APC. The results show that in principle a single APC molecule on a cell can be detected in the presence of background, i.e., autofluorescence and Raman scattering by water.",
