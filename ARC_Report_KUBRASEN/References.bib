abstract={Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a diverse stromal cell population within the tumour microenvironment, where they play fundamental roles in cancer progression and patient prognosis. Multiple lines of evidence have identified that CAFs are critically involved in shaping the structure and function of the tumour microenvironment with numerous functions in regulating tumour behaviours, such as metastasis, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAFs can interact extensively with cancer cells by producing extracellular vesicles (EVs), multiple secreted factors, and metabolites. Notably, CAF-derived EVs have been identified as critical mediators of cancer therapy resistance, and constitute novel therapy targets and biomarkers in cancer management. This review aimed to summarize the biological roles and detailed molecular mechanisms of CAF-derived EVs in mediating cancer resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapy agents, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of CAF-derived EVs as novel targets and clinical biomarkers in cancer clinical management, thereby providing a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing cancer therapy efficacy and improving patient prognosis.},

              effective early diagnosis and treatment strategies to reduce the
              burden of this devastating tumor. Small extracellular vesicles,

This assay is compared with three other approaches: radiographic imaging, assay of cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) levels, and assay of circulating tumor cells. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide.1 Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease but is treatable by means of serial administration of endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic therapies. The monitoring of treatment response is essential to avoid continuing ineffective therapies, to prevent unnecessary side effects, and to determine the benefit of new therapeutics. Treatment response is generally assessed with the use of serial imaging, but radiographic measurements often fail to detect changes in tumor burden. Therefore, there is an urgent need for biomarkers that measure tumor burden with high sensitivity .\&nbsp;.\&nbsp;. }
